Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.
Definition:

    Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination that occurs when an AI system produces outcomes that favor or disadvantage certain groups due to biased training data, flawed model design, or unequal access to information.

Examples:

    Biased Hiring Algorithms
    An AI recruitment system trained mainly on résumés from men may rank male candidates higher and unfairly filter out women.

Biased Facial Recognition
Facial recognition models trained on predominantly light-skinned faces often misidentify or fail to recognize darker-skinned individuals, leading to unequal error rates across groups.

Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?
Transparency:

    Transparency means being open about how an AI system is built and operates — including data sources, model type, processes, and assumptions.

I t focuses on what is inside the system.

Explainability:

    Explainability refers to the ability of the AI system to provide understandable reasons for its predictions or decisions.
    It focuses on why the system produced a specific output.

Why both matter:

    Transparency builds trust and allows stakeholders (developers, regulators, users) to inspect how the model functions and identify risks.

    Explainability helps users and auditors understand model decisions, detect unfair outcomes, and ensure accountability.

    Together, they ensure AI systems are trustworthy, auditable, compliant, and ethical.

Q3: How does GDPR impact AI development in the EU?

    The GDPR significantly affects AI development by imposing strict rules on data handling, user rights, and automated decisions.

Key impacts:

    Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation
    AI developers must collect only the data necessary for a specific purpose and cannot reuse it freely.

Right to Explanation / Right to Access
Individuals can request meaningful explanations for automated decisions that affect them, pushing developers to create more explainable AI systems.

Strict Consent Requirements
AI systems must obtain explicit and informed consent for processing personal data.

Restrictions on Automated Decision-Making
GDPR limits fully automated decisions that significantly affect individuals unless safeguards are in place.

Overall, GDPR enforces privacy, transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI development within the EU.
